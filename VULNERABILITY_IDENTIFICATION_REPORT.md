##  Vulnerability Summary by Module

### 1. **Authentication (`app/auth.py`)**
- **SQL Injection**: The `login` and `register` routes are vulnerable to SQL injection due to the use of unsafe f-strings in database queries. This allows for authentication bypass.
- **Plaintext Password Storage**: Passwords are stored in the database without hashing, exposing them in case of a data breach.
- **User Enumeration**: The login form provides different responses for valid and invalid usernames, allowing attackers to identify existing users.
- **Session Fixation**: Session management is insecure, making it possible for an attacker to hijack a user's session.
- **Lack of Input Validation**: User-provided data is not properly validated, opening the door to various injection attacks.

### 2. **Admin Panel (`app/admin.py`)**
- **Broken Access Control**: Admin routes lack proper authorization checks, allowing any authenticated user to access administrative functions.
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**: The user removal functionality is not protected against CSRF, which could lead to an administrator unknowingly deleting users.
- **Privilege Escalation**: The admin registration page is open, allowing any user to register as an administrator.

### 3. **Chat (`app/chat.py`)**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: The application does not sanitize user messages, allowing attackers to inject and execute malicious scripts in other users' browsers.
- **Broken Access Control**: Users can access messages and user lists that they are not authorized to view.
- **No Rate Limiting**: The chat API lacks rate limiting, making it vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks through message spamming.

### 4. **Dashboard (`app/dashboard.py`)**
- **Information Disclosure**: Sensitive system information (e.g., OS, CPU, memory, running processes) is exposed to all authenticated users, regardless of their role.

### 5. **System Info (`app/system_info.py`)**
- **Information Disclosure**: Exposes detailed system information, similar to the dashboard.
- **Resource Exhaustion (DoS)**: The collection of system process information is inefficient and can be exploited to cause a Denial of Service.

### 6. **Database (`app/db.py`)**
- **Plaintext Password Storage**: Reinforces the authentication vulnerability by design in the database schema.
- **No `UNIQUE` Constraint on Email**: The `users` table does not enforce unique email addresses, leading to potential data integrity issues.
